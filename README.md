# spelunx-clone

Untitled spelunx clone. Will give name later.

## Basic Concept

It's a tribute to the game Spelunx by Cyan, but this has some new features:

  * Basic RPG stats, you can randomly encounter monsters
  * Various minigames
  * Oldschool Spelunx-like action!
  * Inventory
  
## Setting

An abandoned arcade. There are no NPCs. Creepy feels.

And maybe strange things start to happen as you progress in the game (the lights go out, weird noises, you see people's shadows in other rooms but when you go there they're gone, etc.).
